# Documenter Agent

This project implements the Documenter Agent of a multi-agent system
for automated software architecture design.

The Documenter Agent:
- does not make architectural decisions
- does not evaluate trade-offs
- generates structured architectural documentation
  from a finalized architecture description (JSON input)
